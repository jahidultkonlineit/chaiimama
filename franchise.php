Chaiimama Charity Foundation (CCF) is a philanthropic organization dedicated to supporting 
street hawkers who are struggling to develop their businesses. Our primary goal is to uplift 
these individuals and provide them with opportunities for growth and stability. <br> <br>
At CCF, we firmly believe that education and health are fundamental rights that should be 
accessible to all. With this in mind, we have committed to donating 2% of our business profits 
to street hawkers and their family members, specifically for educational and healthcare 
purposes.<br> <br>
Education is a powerful tool that can break the cycle of poverty and empower individuals to 
create a better future for themselves and their communities. By supporting the education of 
street hawkers and their families, we aim to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary 
to improve their lives and escape the hardships of the streets. We provide financial assistance 
for school fees, books, uniforms, and other educational resources, ensuring that no deserving 
child is left behind due to financial constraints.<br> <br>
Furthermore, we understand that good health is essential for individuals to thrive and succeed. 
Many street hawkers face numerous health challenges due to their living conditions and lack 
of access to proper healthcare. CCF strives to bridge this gap by offering medical support, 
including funding for necessary treatments, medications, and regular health check-ups. By 
addressing their healthcare needs, we hope to enhance the well-being of street hawkers and 
contribute to their overall quality of life.<br> <br>
CCF also recognizes the importance of community engagement and empowerment. We 
organize workshops and training programs to enhance the business skills and entrepreneurial 
abilities of street hawkers. By equipping them with the knowledge and resources they need to 
develop their businesses, we aim to create sustainable livelihoods and promote self-sufficiency.<br> <br>
To ensure transparency and accountability, CCF maintains a rigorous monitoring and 
evaluation system. We track the impact of our donations and regularly communicate the 
progress and success stories of the individuals we support. Through this approach, we aim to 
inspire trust and encourage continued support from our donors and the wider community.<br> <br>
In conclusion, Chaiimama Charity Foundation (CCF) is a charitable organization dedicated to 
uplifting street hawkers by providing support for their education and healthcare needs. By 
allocating 2% of our business profits, we strive to make a meaningful and lasting impact on the 
lives of these individuals and their families. Together, we can create a brighter future and help 
them break free from the cycle of poverty
